# MYH-Redesigned

This is a project to redesign the Swedish National Agency for Higher Vocational Education website, utilizing HTML and CSS primarily.

I worked on the project with a group of five other students, focusing on the "statistik"-part of the website, with the goal of making it more responsive and accessible for a wider range of users.
